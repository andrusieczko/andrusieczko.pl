          <p>HTML5 - web programming is so much more fun with HTML5 now! One of my roles in my current job is to

          nearby :)</p>

        <div class="box">
          I've worked in Java for 2.5 years. I used to work in a very ambitious project for 2 years, now I'm using Java for writing some functional GUI tests in my current project. Java for me is a place where I can forget for a while about the crazy world of JavaScript and write something really logical and with a sophisticated architecture :)

        <a class="btn btn-gray">PHP</a>
        <div class="box">PHP... That's a hard topic. I obviously know this language - because of my job (we've got backend written in PHP) and my previous works (most of them in PHP). The reason that I mention it is that I'm a little bit experienced in Symfony and object oriented PHP.</div>

          My dream would be to have a language which:
          <ul>
            <li>gives such a convinience in programming as Java</li>
            <li>allows to pass pointers to functions like in C++</li>
            <li>has <i>var</i> key and LinQ like in C#</li>
            <li>has funcional programming possibilities like Python</li>
            <li>gives as much fun as JavaScript does</li>

        <div class="box">
          I'm coordinating quite a big project at the moment. I love talking to people much more than programming. I can't image my work without communication with others. One of my main personal goals is to convince people that all the stakeholders and programmers are one team, they should work together. It would be awesome if they could go for beer together!

          <p>I work with an amazing team! We're all trying to learn from each other, we're trying to be better each day. We're all searching for the best solutions in StackOverflow, we all love to go for several beers.</p>
          <p>Why did I put it here? Because I don't imagine the work without a great integration with a team. Team work is often more important than particular individual's skills.</p>
