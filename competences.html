          <p>HTML5 - I could just write it and it should contain CSS and JS. That's why HTML5's approach is so awesome :) Sure, there's still a lot work to do but it's so much better now!</p>

        <div class="box">
          I've worked in Java for 2.5 years. I used to work in a very ambitious project for 2 years, now I'm using Java for writing some functional GUI tests in my current project. Java for me is a place where I can forget for a while about the crazy world of JavaScript and write something really logical and with a sophisticated architecture :)

          My dream would be to have a language which:
          <ul>
            <li>gives such a convinience in programming as Java</li>
            <li>allows to pass pointers to functions like in C++</li>
            <li>has <i>var</i> key and LinQ like in C#</li>
            <li>has funcional programming possibilities like Python</li>
            <li>gives as much fun as JavaScript does</li>

          I'm coordinating quite a big project at the moment. I love talking to people much more than programming. I can't image my work without communication with others. One of my main personal goals is to convince people that  all the stakeholders and programmers are one team, they should work together. It would be awesome if they could go for beer together!

          <p>Why did I put it here? Because I don't imagine the work without a great integration with a team. Team work is often more important than particular individual's skills.</p>
