            <p>When I was at highschool, I didn't know what to choose: Romance studies or computer science. Computer science won but I love learning different languages. It doesn't mean that I'm pro or incredibly talented (even in English I <strike>do</strike> make many mistakes) but I really enjoy getting to know the basics of different languages. If you try to understand the language, you're on the best way to get to know people.</p>

            <p>That's an illness. Everytime I hear someone speaks English, I try to recognize where's he/she from. I'm not good at that and probably that's why my girlfriend is always irritated about that. But still, it's an addiction :) I can get lost on YouTube trying to hear the difference between some English and American words:)</p>
